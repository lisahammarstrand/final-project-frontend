# About

This is a project built within Technigo Frontent Bootcamp, final sprint. It is an opportunity to experiment with the tools we have used, and deep-dive into the parts that we would like to practice more. The objective with the project is to wrap up everything we have learnt during the program and to build one bigger application.

## How

Following the requirements I used:
Frontend – React, React Router, React Hooks, styled Components. I focused on understanding and practice Styled Components and think in reusable components. This is something I will explore further after handing in, I realize more pages and components could be made reusable. 
Backend in separate repo - Express, MongoDB, Mongoose is used for creating API REST endpoints and storing and fetching data, along with crypto anf bcrypt for secure password handling. 

### If I had more time – strech goals

I will continue to explore how to make more components and pages reusable. Also look into a more appropriate way to animate accordions with different heights (height auto) which seems to be quite an issue. Something I really want to expand and develop is the my page content, and workout stats and entries, I only had time to do a very basic update function, and even that took a lot of time to figure out. For example to increment the progress bar, write workout posts with dates, get notifcations when getting close to a bonus level etc.

Workout programs should also be on different levels - Soft, Medium, Tough.

Weather info could be included by 3:rd party API.

The booking process also needs some more attention, with more fields like number of people, gear rental and more.
