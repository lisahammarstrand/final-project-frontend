# About

This is a project built within the Technigo Frontent Bootcamp, final sprint. It is an opportunity to experiment with the tools and techniques we have used, and deep-dive into the parts that we would like to practice more. The objective is to wrap up everything we have learnt during the program and to build one bigger application. The timeframe for this project was 4 weeks 50% (ie halftime).


## How

Following the requirements I used:
Frontend – React, React Router, React Hooks and added on Styled Components. I focused on understanding and practice Styled Components and
how to structure and create reusable components. This is something I will
explore further, more pages and components in the project are suitable to be reusable.

Backend in a separate repo - here I used Express, MongoDB, Mongoose to create an API with RESTful endpoints, and storing and fetching data. Crypto and bcrypt was implemented for secure password handling.


### If I had more time – strech goals

I will continue to explore how to make more components and pages reusable. Also look into a more appropriate way to animate accordions with different heights (height auto) which seems to be quite an issue. Something I really want to expand and develop is the my page content, with workout stats and entries. I only had time to do a very basic update function, and even that took a lot of time to figure out. For example to increment the progress bar, write workout posts with dates, get notifcations when getting close to a bonus level etc.

Workout programs should also be on different levels - Soft, Medium, Tough.

Weather info could be included by 3:rd party API, as well as any other useful information from the destination.

The booking process also needs some more attention, with more fields like number of people, gear rental and more.
