            <p>Situated far east in the Lappland mountains, Kittelfj√§ll gets enormous
            dumps of dry inland snow.
            This mythical area has probably the most powder days in Scandinavia,
            and attracts skiers who seek the wild and unexploited.

                  <p>Basically any cardio is useful as long as a
                  major part of your muscles are used and the
                  intensity is high enough to increase your
                  heart rate. To prepare your endurance for
                  ski touring find the nearest ski slope or
                  hill and walk up and down. As a reference, Hammarbybacken in Stockholm
                  is 93,5 altimeters. Start with a few turns and increase each time.
                  With or without skis.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each cardio workout: min 1 hour</p>
