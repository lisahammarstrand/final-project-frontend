            <p>Situated far east in the Lappland mountains, Kittelfjäll gets enormous dumps of dry inland snow. This mythical area has probably the most powder days in Scandinavia, and attracts skiers who seek the wild and unexploited.

                <h2>CARDIO</h2>
                <p>Basically any cardio is useful as long as a major part of your muscles are used and the intensity is high enough to increase your heart rate. To prepare your endurance for ski touring find the nearest ski slope or hill and walk up and down. As a reference, Hammarbybacken in Stockholm is 93,5 altimeters. Start with a few turns and increase each time. With or without skis.</p>
                <p>Each cardio workout: min 1 hour</p>
