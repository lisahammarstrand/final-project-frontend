            <p>Storulvån lies at the end of the road deep in the mountain realm, as a safe pair of arms at the foot of the mountain. It attracts a wonderful mixture of skiers, people out to enjoy the good life, and experienced mountaineering experts, all through the year. The silence and wide open spaces beckon from right outside the door.

                <h2>CARDIO</h2>
                <p>Basically any cardio is useful as long as a major part of your muscles are used and the intensity is high enough to increase your heart rate. To prepare your endurance for ski touring find the nearest ski slope or hill and walk up and down. As a reference, Hammarbybacken in Stockholm is 93,5 altimeters. Start with a few turns and increase each time. With or without skis.</p>
                <p>Each cardio workout: min 1 hour</p>
