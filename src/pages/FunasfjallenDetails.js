            <p>Having the Northern Arctic Ocean as a snow-blower, it is no surprise that Riksgränsen is reputed to provide among the best skiing in Sweden.
            The area provides plenty of easy accessible off-piste, like Nordalsfjäll where the Scandinavian Big Mountain Championships are held every year.

              CARDIO
              Basically any cardio is useful as long as a major part of your muscles are used and the intensity is high enough to increase your heart rate. To prepare your endurance for ski touring find the nearest ski slope or hill and walk up and down. As a reference, Hammarbybacken in Stockholm is 93,5 altimeters. Start with a few turns and increase each time. With or without skis.

              Each cardio workout: min 1 hour
