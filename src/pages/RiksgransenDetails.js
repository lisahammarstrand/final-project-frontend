            <p>Having the Northern Arctic Ocean as a snow-blower,
            it is no surprise that Riksgr√§nsen is reputed to provide among
            the best skiing in Sweden.
            The area provides plenty of easy accessible off-piste,
            like Nordalsfj√§ll where the Scandinavian Big Mountain Championships are held every year.

                  <p>Basically any cardio is useful as long as a
                  major part of your muscles are used and the
                  intensity is high enough to increase your
                  heart rate. To prepare your endurance for
                  ski touring find the nearest ski slope or
                  hill and walk up and down. As a reference, Hammarbybacken in Stockholm
                  is 93,5 altimeters. Start with a few turns and increase each time.
                  With or without skis and poles, depending on the season.
